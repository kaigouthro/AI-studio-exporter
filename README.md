## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Complete Export**: Exports entire conversation history from Google AI Studio.
- 🖼️ **Media Preservation**: Includes all image attachments in the export.

### 🔐 Security & Privacy
- Extension pages now ship with an explicit CSP (`script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'`) for defense in depth.
- Popup and background logic only interact with `https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/` tabs.
- Messages between scripts are validated and rejected when untrusted or malformed.
- User settings are sanitized before use to avoid unexpected values.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting & known issues

- **Exported markdown file is missing formatting and spacing for messages**: This is a known issue. We are working on a fix. 
    - **Workaround**: refresh the AI Studio page and ensure that when the page is fully loaded, raw mode is turned off by default. If not, turn it off manually and then reload the page.
    - **Note**: Ensure the page is fully loaded before starting the export!
-   **Export button is disabled or "Not on AI Studio" message**: Make sure you are on a valid AI Studio conversation page and that the page has fully loaded. Try refreshing the page.
-   **Export fails or hangs**: Wait for the AI Studio page to load completely before starting the export. If the issue persists, check the browser's developer console (F12) for errors and open a GitHub issue.
